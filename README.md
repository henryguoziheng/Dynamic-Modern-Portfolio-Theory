# Dynamic-Modern-Portfolio-Theory
Dynamic asset allocation strategy under modern portfolio theory. 

This work is based on paper by Li & Ng (2000) and extended to no-shorting selling cases. 

The work is a stochastic control problem to find optimized asset allocation strategy such that by the end of the investment the portfolio variance is minimized with a fixed expected return.
